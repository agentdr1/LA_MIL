## Local Attention Multiple Instance Learning - PyTorch

Implementation of LA_MIL in PyTorch.



## Local attention - Change the neighborhoods
<img src="./local_neighborhoods_vis.gif" />

You can change the neighborhood size according to your particular task as an user-specified inductive bias.



## Visualisation of Attention and latent space 

<img src="./attention_and_embedding_vis.png" width="500x"></img>

You can visualise attentive regions and also catch the embedding, which is the output of the mean pooling operation. 


Pip package and code follow asap. Stay tuned
